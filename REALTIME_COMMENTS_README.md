# Real-Time Comments Feature

## Overview
The comments system now supports real-time updates using Supabase Realtime subscriptions. When users post comments or replies, they appear instantly for all users viewing the same post without requiring a page refresh.

## How It Works

### 1. Real-Time Subscriptions
- **Comments Channel**: Subscribes to changes in the `comments` table for the specific post
- **Replies Channel**: Subscribes to changes in the `replies` table for the specific post's comments
- **Automatic Updates**: When a comment or reply is added/deleted, all connected users see the update immediately

### 2. Implementation Details

#### Setup Process
1. When a user opens a post modal, `setupRealtimeSubscriptions()` is called
2. Two Supabase channels are created:
   - `comments-{postId}` for comment changes
   - `replies-{postId}` for reply changes
3. Each channel listens for INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE events

#### Cleanup Process
- Subscriptions are automatically cleaned up when:
  - Modal is closed
  - Component unmounts
  - User navigates away

### 3. Visual Indicators
- **Live Badge**: A green pulsing dot with "Live" text appears next to "Comments"
- **Success Message**: "Comment posted! (Live updates enabled)" shows when posting

## Technical Benefits

### Performance
- **No Polling**: Eliminates the need for periodic API calls
- **Efficient**: Only updates when actual changes occur
- **Scalable**: Works well with multiple concurrent users

### User Experience
- **Instant Feedback**: Comments appear immediately
- **No Refresh Needed**: Seamless real-time interaction
- **Visual Confirmation**: Clear indication that updates are live

## Database Requirements

### Supabase Realtime
Make sure your Supabase project has Realtime enabled for the following tables:
- `comments`
- `replies`

### RLS Policies
The existing RLS policies for comments and replies work with real-time subscriptions.

## Testing Real-Time Functionality

1. **Open Multiple Tabs**: Open the same post in multiple browser tabs
2. **Post Comments**: Add comments from different tabs
3. **Verify Updates**: Check that comments appear instantly across all tabs
4. **Test Replies**: Add replies and verify they appear in real-time
5. **Test Deletions**: Delete comments/replies and verify they disappear immediately

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Comments not updating**: Check browser console for subscription errors
2. **Performance issues**: Ensure subscriptions are properly cleaned up
3. **Connection problems**: Verify Supabase Realtime is enabled

### Debug Information
- Check browser console for "Comment change detected" and "Reply change detected" logs
- Verify subscription channels are created and removed properly

## Future Enhancements
